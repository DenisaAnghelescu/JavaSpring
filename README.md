# JavaSpring
This application was developed at one of the Java classes I was enrolled in. 
This was developed with the help of my colleagues and we worked together as a team. 
This advanced topic opened me up towards the technologies used for writing code with Java.
Working for this application, I realised that I will be a forever student in programming, there is always something to learn which is very cool for me as I am eager to learn for more.
